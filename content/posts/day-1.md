# This is the first day of my Journal
<!--more-->

Today the country moved from the tier system to a full national Lockdown and as a result all schools will close. This will mean that I have to try and work at home with both kids screaming and arguing all day. This is during when they should be doing their school work. I have constant questions and interuptions through out the time they are home. This is supposed to last until at least mid-February.

# Today was a bitch
Due to the fact that my Work diary was rearranged to compensate for my recovery from the Covid virus. I had my lunch time removed and did not get a break all day. By the time it came to finish I was knackered. Chris did contact me and stated that he would be reorganising my Diary to make sure that my breaks are in there. and ongoing from here until the OHS report comes through this will mean that for every half an hour I will get a 10 minute break.
